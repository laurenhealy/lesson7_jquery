### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. jQuery is a cross-browser library- meaning it automatically includes various forms of code when necessary to support different browsers. This makes jQuery the most user friendly form of Javascript code.
2. Every jQuery statement starts with $ and is followed by a reference to elements in parenthesis. When the reference is a CSS selector, it is put in quotes within the parenthesis. 
3. When specifying an event handler, backward-compatible event listener is the easiest in jQuery. An event listener consists of starting with a $, specifying a selector for element to carry out the event, and finishing with a method that explains event and actions.
